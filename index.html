            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>
                Students who take Introduction to Computing gain a basic 
                understanding of the theoretical and practical workings 
                of computers and software.  Essential subjects covered in
                 the course include data management, binary number systems, 
                 command-line operations, software types, and the fundamentals 
                 of HTML and CSS web development.  Through a variety of 
                 assignments such CMD activities, data analysis, and webpage 
                 design, it also highlights creativity, critical thinking, 
                 and problem-solving.  The course gives students the fundamental 
                 abilities they need to successfully explore and use technology 
                 in both academic and real-world contexts by fusing lecture 
                 concepts with practical laboratory assignments.

            <h2>Course Learning Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                I learned a lot and had some practical experience in the 
                Introduction to Computing course, which helped me better 
                grasp how technology functions and how it can be used.  
                Each lesson gradually strengthened my technological basis, 
                from understanding various software kinds and command-line 
                functions to converting binary numbers and examining datasets.  
                I was able to use logic and creativity to create and exhibit 
                a webpage using HTML and CSS, resulting in tangible digital 
                solutions.  These exercises increased my technical and analytical
                 abilities as well as my capacity for clear idea planning, 
                 design, and communication.  All things considered, the course
                  inspired me to learn more about programming and technology 
                  in the future and helped me understand how computing relates to daily life.
